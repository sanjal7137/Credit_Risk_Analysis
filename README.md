# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis

The objective of this challenge is to use different machine learning algorithms to predict credit card risk . Use differnt techniques like data preprocessing , data transformation, boosting, bagging, oversampling , undersampling etc to find good candidate for loan. 

PySpark was used to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next,  using PySpark, I determined if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset so that SellBy stakeholders can assess if membership to the Vine program is going to be beneficial.
